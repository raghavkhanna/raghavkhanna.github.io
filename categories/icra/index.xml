      <description>Perception systems for outdoor robotics have to deal with varying environmental conditions. Variations in illumination in particular, are currently the biggest challenge for vision-based perception. In this paper we present an approach for radiometric characterization of multispectral cameras. To enable spatio-temporal mapping we also present a procedure for in-situ illumination estimation, resulting in radiometric calibration of the collected images. In contrast to current approaches, we present a purely data driven, parameter free approach, based on maximum likelihood estimation which can be performed entirely on the field, without requiring specialised laboratory equipment.</description>

      <title>UAV-based crop and weed classification for smart farming</title>

      <description>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and other robots in smart farming applications offer the potential to monitor farm land on a per-plant basis, which in turn can reduce the amount of herbicides and pesticides that must be applied. A central information for the farmer as well as for autonomous agriculture robots is the knowledge about the type and distribu- tion of the weeds in the field. In this regard, UAVs offer excellent survey capabilities at low cost.</description>
