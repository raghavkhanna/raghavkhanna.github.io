      <description>Autonomous driving and electric vehicles are nowadays very active research and development areas. In this paper we present the conversion of a standard Kyburz eRod into an autonomous vehicle that can be operated in challenging environments such as Swiss mountain passes. The overall hardware and software architectures are described in detail with a special emphasis on the sensor requirements for autonomous vehicles operating in partially structured environments. Furthermore, the design process itself and the finalized system architecture are presented.</description>
